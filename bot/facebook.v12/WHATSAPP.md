# [**Get Started With the WhatsApp Business Cloud API**](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/cloud-api/get-started)

## 1. [Set up Developer Assets and Platform Access](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/cloud-api/get-started#set-up-developer-assets)

The [WhatsApp Cloud API](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/cloud-api) are part of Metaâ€™s Graph API, so you need to set up a Meta developer account and a Meta developer app. To set that up:

* [Register as a Meta Developer](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/development/register)
* [Enable two-factor authentication for your account](https://www.facebook.com/help/148233965247823)
* [Create a Meta App](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/development/create-an-app/): Go to **developers.facebook.com** > **My Apps** > **Create App**.</br>Select the "Business" type and follow the prompts on your screen.

From the App Dashboard, click on the app you would like to connect to WhatsApp. Scroll down to find the "WhatsApp" product and click **Set up**.

Next, you will see the option to select an existing Business Manager (if you have one) or, if you would like, the onboarding process can create one automatically for you (you can customize your business later, if needed).

Make a selection and click Continue. This will:

1. Associate your app with the Business Manager account that you selected earlier (or had created for you).
2. Generate a WhatsApp Business account.
3. Generate a test business phone number and associate it with your WhatsApp Business Account. You can use this number with the API to send an unlimited number of messages to up to 5 recipient phone numbers. Recipient phone numbers can be any valid number, but you must verify each one in the next step.
4. Redirect you to the **WhatsApp** > **Getting Started** (or **Setup**) panel in the App Dashboard.

## 2. [Generate Meta Business Manager System User permanent access token](https://digitalinspiration.com/docs/document-studio/apps/whatsapp/token)

To create a permanent access token to make calls to the WhatsApp Business Platform Cloud API as an authenticated user.

1. Inside your Facebook App Dashboard, Go to **Business Settings** > **Users** > **System Users**. Click on the **Add** button to create a new system user.
Give your system user a unique username and set the role to **Admin**. Click on **Create System user** to continue. You'll be redirected to the system user's profile page.

2. Click on **Add Assets** to assign your app to the system user. Go to the **Apps** tab and select your app from the list. Turn on the **Full Control** > **Manage App** option and click on **Save Changes**.

3. Click on **Generate New Token** to generate a permanent access token for your system user. Select your app name from the dropdown and enable the following permissions.

   * **whatsapp_business_management**
   * **whatsapp_business_messaging**

Click on **Generate Token**, and an access token will be generated for your system user. Please copy the access token in your notepad as it will not be visible again in your Facebook dashboard.

Unlike the temporary access token, this permanent access token will never expire unless you manually revoke it.

Your app is now ready to send WhatsApp messages. You can use this permanent access token to integrate your WhatsApp Business Account(s) with **Webitel** > **Chat Gateway** > type:**Messenger** > tab:**WhatsApp**.

> **NOTE**: _For more information see how to [Add System Users to Your Meta Business Manager](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/503306463479099), [Install Apps and Generate Tokens](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/marketing-api/system-users/install-apps-and-generate-tokens#install-apps-and-generate-tokens)._

## [Phone Number](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/cloud-api/get-started#phone-number)

For a production use case, you need to use your own phone number to send messages to your users. When choosing a phone number, consider the following:

* If you want to use a number that is already being used in the WhatsApp customer or business app, you will have to fully migrate that number to the business platform. Once the number is migrated, you will lose access to the WhatsApp customer or business app. See [Migrate Existing WhatsApp Number to a Business Account](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/cloud-api/get-started/migrate-existing-whatsapp-number-to-a-business-account) for information.
* Meta WhatsApp Business Platform have a set of rules regarding numbers that can be used. [Learn more](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/phone-numbers#pick-number).
* Once you have chosen your phone number, you have to add it to your WhatsApp Business Account. See [Add a Phone Number](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/cloud-api/get-started/add-a-phone-number).
