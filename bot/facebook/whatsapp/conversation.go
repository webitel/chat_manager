// Information about the conversation.
//
// WhatsApp defines a conversation as a 24-hour session of messaging between a person and a business.
// There is no limit on the number of messages that can be exchanged in the fixed 24-hour window.
// The 24-hour conversation session begins when:
// * A business-initiated message is delivered to a customer
// * A businessâ€™ reply to a customer message is delivered
//
// The 24-hour conversation session is different from the 24-hour customer support window.
// The customer support window is a rolling window that is refreshed when a customer-initiated message is delivered to a business.
// Within the customer support window businesses can send free-form messages.
// Any business-initiated message sent more than 24 hours after the last customer message must be a template message.

	// Date when the conversation expires.
	// This field is only present for messages with a `status` set to `sent`.
